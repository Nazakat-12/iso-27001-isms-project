#  Mini ISO 27001 ISMS Implementation Portfolio

This repository showcases a hands-on implementation of core documentation required for an Information Security Management System (ISMS), aligning with the requirements of the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard.

This project demonstrates proficiency in developing an organizational framework for managing information security risks and ensuring regulatory compliance.

##  Demonstrated Skills and Project Artifacts

The key value of this project lies in the creation of foundational documentation that addresses specific ISO 27001 clauses:

| Artifact | Purpose (ISO 27001 Clause) | Key Security Skill Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **info-sec-policy.md** | High-level commitments and direction (Clause 5.2) | Policy Drafting, Management Commitment |
| **scope.md** | Defining the boundaries and applicability of the ISMS (Clause 4.3) | Organizational Context and Scoping |
| **risk-register.md** | Documenting identified risks, analysis, and treatment decisions (Clause 6.1.2) | Formal Risk Assessment & Management |
| **soa.md** | Statement of Applicability (Mapping of Annex A Controls) (Clause 6.1.3) | Control Selection and Justification |
| **incident-response.md**| Operational steps for a critical security process (Clause 8.3) | Procedure Development, Operational Resilience |



##  Repository Structure and Navigation

The documents are logically organized to reflect the hierarchical structure of an ISMS:
iso_project/
├── policies/ │
└── info-sec-policy.md # Strategic direction for information security. 
├── procedures/ │ └── incident-response.md # Actionable steps for handling security events.
├── README.md # This project overview. ├── risk-register.md # The output of the risk assessment process.
├── scope.md # Defines the boundaries of the ISMS implementation.
└── soa.md # Justifies the set of security controls adopted.
